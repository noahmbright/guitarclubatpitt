        <p>Hi, I’m Sam! I’m a biology major with a minor in chemistry. After graduation, I’m planning to pursue a career as a Physician Assistant. I started playing the guitar when I was in high school and have really only played “casually” ever since. I like to sing and play so if I must admit...I’ve stuck to the typical “4 chords that can play any song”, although I have recently attempted to learn some finger picking. I’m excited for this semester and I look forward to getting to know you all!</p>
